# Git grok

I've read dozens of git tutorials and skimmed through reference material every now and then. Even though I've been using git for over an year, there are sometimes I just get stuck - I don't know where to start searching for my solution and even if I find an answer, I have no clue what it does or why it does it that way. This all boils down to the fact that I haven't yet groked git well enough.

For this purpose I'm curating a scenario based tutorial which will help newbies understand what all they can do with git and how. The idea is to make it like a story of some sort. Step by step you build your repo and tackle yourself through increasingly sticky situations.
